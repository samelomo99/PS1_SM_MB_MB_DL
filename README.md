# Problem Set Template Repository for Big Data and Machine Learning for Applied Economics

This is the template repository for the problem sets.

The repo should contain at least four folders:

- `document`: contains your final document in `pdf` format. Ideally, the document should pull figures and tables directly from the `views` folder. I've included a latex template I created for the Thesis Seminar. 
- `scripts`: contains all your scripts
- `stores`: contains all the data sets used. If files are "too big" for GitHub, include a document describing where people can access the data.
- `views`: contains all figures and tables
